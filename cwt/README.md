Continuous Wavelet Transform Method
===================================

The [`pycwt1d`](pycwt1d) directory contains the code of the
**continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method** proposed by
[Gu et al. 2013, ApJ, 773, 38](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773...38G)
to remove the foreground contamination.

The code is derived from the original author
[Junhua GU](https://github.com/astrojhgu)
with various small modifications to make it much easier to build and use.

The upstreams of this code are:
* [`pycwt1d`](https://github.com/astrojhgu/pycwt1d)
* [`cwt1d`](https://github.com/astrojhgu/cwt1d)
* [`fftw_blitz`](https://github.com/astrojhgu/fftw_blitz)
